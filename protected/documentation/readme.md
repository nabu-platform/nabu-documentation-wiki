# Introduction to Nabu

Nabu is a development acceleration platform that allows you to build complex applications much faster than you would be able to with more traditional approaches such as Java and .NET.
It achieves this acceleration by skipping a critical step on traditional development: programming.

Everything you build in Nabu is through GUI's rather than a textual interface. This allows the platform to abstract away the technical details and lets you focus on the business logic of what you are trying to build.

While this obviates the need for true programming skills, the platform still assumes the person building the software has a good grip on the conceptual knowledge necessary to build a sustainable solution.
This means understanding how horizontal scaling can help your application grow, how API's should be designed and what a data model is. Once you understands these concepts however, Nabu tries to make it as easy as possible to express your solution, without having to resort to code to do so.
